# Network_RSA

BROKEN NEED TO FIX: RSA CLASS

This project shows what I learned in my studies; that is how to use a RSA encryption on a network, 
with a server client architecuter, to encrypt a message from the client to the server. 
The program also has a user login function. the login funtion works of  the Leslie Lamport hashing function. 
The project was originally done in C for an assignment with the Leslie Lamport hashing function, without RSA. 
After my semest concluded I decided to redo the assignment in python and add RSA encryption.

As the the project current stands it still needs to polishing. I decide to upload it as a back up.
